**Before running script**

ðŸ‘‰ Install `requests` library
ðŸ‘‰ Stop VPN if you have one, IPs from other countries are blocked (I guess)


ðŸ“‹ **Todo:**

ðŸ‘‰ Exception handling (if request is timed out, script thorws error on console)
ðŸ‘‰ JSON output
ðŸ‘‰ Restructure code and comment whereever possible
